Algorithm: string operations such as compare, concatenate, string length.

Purpose: To find String length, Compare two Strings, Concatenate two strings
Input: Two strings
Output: Length of string1
	Concatenated String
	Comparison of two strings
START
	STEP 1: [Store two strings in Str1 and Str2]
		Str1=String1 and Str2=String2

	STEP 2:[To find String Length]
		initialize i to 0
		while(str[i] not equal to 0)
			increment i by 1

	STEP 3: [To Compare two Strings]
		initialize i to 0
		while (str1[i] is equal to str2[i])
			if (str1[i] is equal to null)
				break;
			increment i by 1
			return str1[i]-str2[i];

	STEP 4: [To Concatenate two Strings]
		initialize i to 0 and j to 0
		while (str1[i] not equal to null)
			increment i by 1
		while (str2[j] not equal to null)
			str1[i++]=str2[j++];

	STEP 5: [Output the results]
		The length of the String
		res1=Comparision of two Strings
		res2= Concatenated String
STOP
