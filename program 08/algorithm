PURPOSE : Multiply 2 matrices
INPUT: Two matrices
OUTPUT : Multiplication of 2 matrices

START

	STEP 1: [Read the order of matrix A]
		Read m,n

	STEP 2: [Read the order of matrix B]
		Read p,q

	STEP 3 : [Check for compatible]
		If n!=p
			Print matrix multiplication not possible
			Goto step 10

	STEP 4 : [Read the elements of matrix A]
		For i->0 to m-1 do
			For j->0 to n-1 do
				Read a[i][j]
			End jth for loop
		End ith for loop

	STEP 5: [Read the elements of matrix B]
		For i->0 to p-1 do
			For j 0 to q-1 do
				Read b[i][j]
			End jth for loop
		End ith for loop

	STEP 6: [Compute multiplication]
		For i->0 to m-1 do
			For j->0 to q-1 do
				C[i][j]-> 0
				For k->0 to n-1 do
					C[i][j] c[i][j]+a[i][k]*b[k][j]
				End kth for loop
			End jth for loop
		End ith for loop

	STEP 7: [Display matrix A]
		For i->0 to m-1 do
			For j->0 to n-1 do
				Print a[i][j]
			End jth for loop
		End ith for loop

	STEP 8: [Display matrix B]
		For i->0 to p-1 do
			For j->0 to q-1 do
				Print b[i][j]
			End jth for loop
		End ith for loop

	STEP 9: [Display matrix C]
		For i->0 to m-1 do
			For j 0 to n-1 do
				Print c[i][j]
			End jth for loop
		End ith for loop

	STEP 10: [Finished]
STOP
