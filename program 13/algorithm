PURPOSE: To Implement structures to read, write, compute average- marks and the
	students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students.
Input: number of Students, name ,marks1,marks2,marks3
Output: Average marks and printing the students scoring above and below the average marks

START
	STEP 1: [input number of students]
		Read n

	STEP 2: [input details of students ie.name amd marks]
		Read name,m1,m2,m3

	STEP 3: [ Calculate total and average]
		For <- i=0 to n
			s[i].total=(s[i].m1+s[i].m2+s[i].m3);
			T=T+s[i].total;
			AVG=T/N;

	STEP 4: [Find students above and below average]
		for <-i=0 to n
		if 
			aboveavg[j]=i;
			j++;
		else
			belowavg[k]=i;
			k++;

	STEP 5:[Finished]
STOP
