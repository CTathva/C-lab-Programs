PURPOSE: Implement Binary search
INPUT: n, a[50], key
OUTPUT: key is present at the position or key not found

START
	STEP 1: [Read no of elements]
		Read n

	STEP 2: [Read the elements of the array]
		For <- i=0 to n
			Read a[i]
		End ith for loop

	STEP 3: [Read the elements to be searched]
		Read key

	STEP 4: [Initiliazation]
		low = 0;
		high = n-1;

	STEP 5: [ Check whearther low is less than of equal to high and calculate mid)
		while <- low <=high
		mid= (low+ high)/2;

	STEP 6: [Check if mid is equal to key )
		If a[mid] is equal to key

	STEP 7: [print the key position]
		Print key is present at the position mid+1

	STEP 8: [if key found initialize found is 1]
		found=1

	STEP 9: [check if mid is greater than key and calculate]
		If mid is greater than key
		high = mid-1;

	STEP 10: [Else]
		low = mid+1;

	STEP 11: [Check if key is not found]
		If not found
		Print key not found

	STEP 12:[Finished]
STOP
