ALGORITHM : Bubble sort

PURPOSE : Arranging the numbers in ascending order using bubble sort technique
INPUT : N, interger numbers in arrary a[i]
OUTPUT : Numbers are arranged in ascending order

START
	STEP 1: [Input number of elements]
		Read n

	STEP 2: [Input the elements/numbers into array]
		For i->0 to n
			Read a[i]
		Endfor

	STEP 3 : [Sorting the elements in ascending order]
		For i->0 to n-1
			For j->0 to n-1
				If(a[j]>a[j+1]) then                    [Compare the adjacent elements]
					Temp -> a[j]			[Swap these elements]
					a[j] -> a[j+1]
					a[j+1] -> Temp
				endif
			endfor
		endfor

	STEP 4: [Display the sorted elements of array]
		For i->0 to n
			Print a[i]
		Endfor

	STEP 5: [Finished]
STOP
