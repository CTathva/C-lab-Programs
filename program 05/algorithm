INPUT: name [10], unit
OUTPUT: Print the charges for total number of units consumed

START
	STEP 1: [Input a name and units]
		read name and unit

	STEP 2: [Initialization]
		Metercharge=100

	STEP3: [To check electricity unit is less than or equal to 200 and calculate metercharge] 
		If unit less than or equal to 200
			metercharge= metercharge+(unit*.80)

	STEP 4: [Else check unit is greater than 200 and greater than 300 and calculate metercharge]
		If unit greater than 200 and unit greater than or equal to 300
			metercharge= metercharge+(200*0.80)+((unit-200)*0.90))

	STEP 5: [Else check unit is greater than 300 and calculate metercharge]
		If unit is greater than 300
			metercharge= metercharge+(200*0.80)+(300*0.90)+((unit-300)*1))

	STEP 6: [To check and calculate if meter charge is greater than 400 ]
		If metercharge greater than or equal to 400
			metercharge=metercharge+(metercharge*0.15);

	STEP 7: [Finished]
STOP
